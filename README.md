# Project Name

> Backgrounds and Gradients

This is a project based on an archived Apple website. In this project I used all the previous knowledge and I also applied some new knowledge for background images and gradients. This website is responsive but the main design was based on a small-sized archive website; this means the optimal size is approximately 1,026 x 829p, and the scaled Full HD 1920 x 1080p looks like the second image.
